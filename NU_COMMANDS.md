## üéØ Production Workflows

### Weekly Invoice Generation
```nu
# Monday morning workflow
cd ~/devqai/inv_gen

# 1. Check last week's data
sqlite3 invoices.db "SELECT * FROM invoices ORDER BY pk DESC LIMIT 1" | from csv

# 2. Generate new invoice
http post http://localhost:8000/invoice/generate

# 3. Review and approve (get invoice number from response)
let invoice_num = "N027"
http post $"http://localhost:8000/invoice/approve/($invoice_num)"

# 4. Verify email sent
print "‚úÖ Check email for confirmation"

# 5. Update database
python3 invoice_cli.py submit $invoice_num
```

# Current month summary
let current_month = (date now | format date "%Y-%m")

sqlite3 invoices.db $"
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as invoices,
  SUM(total_hours) as hours,
  printf('$%.2f', SUM(line_total)) as revenue,
  SUM(CASE WHEN paid = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as paid_count,
  printf('$%.2f', SUM(CASE WHEN paid = 1 THEN line_total ELSE 0 END)) as paid_amount
FROM invoices 
WHERE strftime('%Y-%m', invoice_create_date) = '($current_month)'
" | from csv
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Nu Shell Patterns

### Loop Through Pending Invoices
```nu
let pending = (sqlite3 invoices.db "
SELECT invoice_number FROM invoices 
WHERE submitted = 0 AND paid = 0
" | from csv)

for invoice in $pending {
    let num = ($invoice | get invoice_number)
    print $"Processing ($num)..."
    python3 invoice_cli.py generate $num
}
```

### Batch Generate PDFs
```nu
sqlite3 invoices.db "SELECT invoice_number FROM invoices" 
| from csv 
| each { |row| 
    python3 invoice_cli.py generate ($row | get invoice_number)
}
```

### Custom Report Function
```nu
def invoice-summary [] {
    let data = (sqlite3 invoices.db "
    SELECT 
      COUNT(*) as total,
      SUM(CASE WHEN paid = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as paid,
      printf('$%.2f', SUM(line_total)) as total_amount
    FROM invoices
    " | from csv | first)
    
    print "üìä Invoice Summary"
    print $"   Total: ($data.total)"
    print $"   Paid: ($data.paid)"
    print $"   Amount: ($data.total_amount)"
}

# Use it:
invoice-summary
```

## üìö Useful Aliases (Add to ~/.config/nushell/config.nu)

```nu
# Quick navigation
alias inv = cd ~/devqai/inv_gen

# Start services
alias inv-server = cd ~/devqai/inv_gen; ./start_server.nu
alias inv-tui = cd ~/devqai/inv_gen/tui; ./bin/invoice-tui

# Quick commands
alias inv-list = python3 ~/devqai/inv_gen/invoice_cli.py list
alias inv-stats = python3 ~/devqai/inv_gen/invoice_cli.py stats

# Database shortcuts
alias inv-db = sqlite3 ~/devqai/inv_gen/invoices.db
alias inv-status = sqlite3 ~/devqai/inv_gen/invoices.db "SELECT CASE WHEN paid = 1 THEN 'Paid' WHEN submitted = 1 THEN 'Submitted' ELSE 'Pending' END as status, COUNT(*) FROM invoices GROUP BY status" | from csv
```

## üéì Learning Resources

### Nu Shell Basics
```nu
# Variables
let name = "value"

# Command substitution
let result = (command arg1 arg2)

# Piping
command1 | command2 | command3

# JSON parsing
http get url | from json | select field1 field2

# CSV parsing
command | from csv

# Tables
ls | where size > 1mb | sort-by size
```

### Common Patterns
```nu
# Check if file exists
if ("file.txt" | path exists) { print "exists" }

# String interpolation
let name = "World"
print $"Hello ($name)!"

# Error handling
let result = (do { risky-command } | complete)
if $result.exit_code != 0 {
    print $"Error: ($result.stderr)"
}
```

## üÜò Troubleshooting Guide

### Server Won't Start
```nu
# Check if port is in use
lsof -i :8000

# Kill existing process
kill -9 (lsof -ti:8000)

# Check .env
cat .env | lines | where $it =~ "GMAIL"
```

### Database Issues
```nu
# Verify database exists
ls invoices.db

# Check table structure
sqlite3 invoices.db ".tables"

# Validate data
sqlite3 invoices.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM invoices" | from csv
```

### Email Problems
```nu
# Test credentials
python3 -c "from email_service import EmailService; import os; from dotenv import load_dotenv; load_dotenv(); print('Credentials loaded')"

# Check SMTP connection
openssl s_client -starttls smtp -connect smtp.gmail.com:587
```
